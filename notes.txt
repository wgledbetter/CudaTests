Just implemented passing classes to device.
Next, I want to test extending a host-only class to a device class.
Because ultimately, I'd like to be able to take my pre-existing astrodynamics code base and write some wrappers to run it on a GPU.

Actually, that might be unreasonable because the code actually needs to be written differently in order to take advantage of what CUDA actually does with blocks and threads.
I should write something in pure CUDA before I try to bridge to C++.
